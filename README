First, copy the 3 .txt file to the directory ~/data
To execute the 1-layer neural network with sigmoid activation:
   python testNeuralNet.py layer1 sigmoid

To execute the 1-layer neural network with relu activation:
   python testNeuralNet.py layer1 relu

To execute the 1-layer neural network with sigmoid activation:
   python testNeuralNet.py layer2 sigmoid

To execute the 1-layer neural network with relu activation:
   python testNeuralNet.py layer2 relu

To change hyperparameters:
   Hardcode in testNeuralNet.py line90-line97

Declaration:
    The code reused the skeleton I wrote in 10601 Machine Learning, as I think the skeleton is great for modifying the
    neural network in the future as it is easy to add more different layers into the network without change the whole
    structure much. All the forward propagation and backward propagation codes are all written by myself previously or
    recently.
